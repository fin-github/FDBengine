# FDBengine
In Simple: A file database package.



## Important Info
I am not good at python nor good at this package stuff. I tried from my ability and if someone can help me get this on PyPi or whatever its called please do help me.

## Installation Info/Instructions NOT ON PIP
To install simply drag the FDBengine.py file to your working directory. Then import it with the follow command:
`import fdbengine`.

## Usage Instructions
To use there are 2 very simple commands `fdbengine.write(filename, value)` and `fdbengine.read(filename)`. You should be able to know these pretty fast.

# What is FDBengine???
FDBengine is a very simple and lightweight python script/package that will assist you with writing and reading stuff to/from files. It is very simple with only 2 commands and should not need a documentation (thats how simple it is). Credit can be as simple as a comment saying `Credits to fin-github for file engine.` Or a big help would be printing my name in the console at the start of your program. For example `print("File engine made by fin-github. FDBengine.")`
