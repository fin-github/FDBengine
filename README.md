# FDBengine
In Simple: A file database package.



## Important Info
I am not good at python nor good at this package stuff. I tried from my ability and if someone can help me get this on PyPi or whatever its called please do help me.

## Installation Info/Instructions NOT ON PIP
To install simply drag the FDBengine.py file to your working directory. Then import it with the follow command:
`import fdbengine`.

## Usage Instructions
To use there are 2 very simple commands `fdbengine.write(filename, value)` and `fdbengine.read(filename)`. You should be able to know these pretty fast.

# What is FDBengine???
FDBengine is a very simple and lightweight python script/package that will assist you with writing and reading stuff to/from files. It is very simple with only 2 commands and should not need a documentation (thats how simple it is). Credit can be as simple as a comment saying `Credits to fin-github for file engine.` Or a big help would be printing my name in the console at the start of your program. For example `print("File engine made by fin-github. FDBengine.")`

# FDBengine LITE or FDBengine FULL
Both are essentially the same (both do databases) except the full version has additional commands which may be more helpful.
If you are looking for more lightweight and to squeeze a little bit more speed out of FDBengine get the LITE version. But if you dont need it to be the fastest of all for sure go with full. Also additional commands are not in LITE.
LITE also gets very minimal updates and sucnificantly less updates than FULL.


# Other
FDBengine is very simple but it also has some additional commands that are pretty usful.
None of these commands should be nessecary for the program to run.
*FDBengine LITE Does not have addition commands for it to be lightweight.
## Logging
You can enable loggings by typing the command `fdbengine.logging(True)` **WITH THE CAPITAL**
And disable by running the command `fdbengine.logging(False)` **WITH THE CAPITAL**
This saves inside of a txt file called *fdbenginelogs.txt*.

***Default: False***

## Create file
This simple command will create a file. The command is `fdbengine.createfile(filename)`.
Its simpler than the write command lol. But this command is not in the LITE version of FDBengine.
